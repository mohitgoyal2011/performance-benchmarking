The code for each module is kept in their named folders. 
However, there are some modules that are run by an outside loop in python. And there are some that are complete modules in their own right.
So to run a module, run the following command

python data_driver.py <no_of_experiment_as_per_description>

As there were 8 descriptions, the experiments are numbered from 1-8. Memory Access Latency starts from 6. The actual functions are in data_parser.py

To install statistics python module, do a pip install statistics.

If you don't have pip - sudo apt-get install python-pip on Ubuntu

NOTE: There are a lot of hard coded values like Loop Overhead that were gotten from other experiments, but not mentioned in the report. However, most of the non trivial ones have been includedin the code.

Please be kind :)
